# covid-tracker-app
The COVID-19 Tracker is a web application built with Flask that allows doctors and patients to track and manage COVID-19 cases. It provides functionalities for doctors to generate and forward results, and for patients to view their reports.

# Features
- **Doctor Dashboard:** Doctors can view a list of X-ray images uploaded by patients, generate results based on a machine learning model, and forward the results to patients.
- **Patient Dashboard:** Patients can view their X-ray images and the corresponding results generated by doctors.
- **Predictive Model:** The app uses a machine learning model to predict whether an X-ray image indicates COVID-19 or is normal.
- **SQLite3 Database:** The app utilizes a SQLite3 database to store X-ray images, patient information, and generated results.

# Technologies Used
- Flask: A Python web framework used for building the application.
- SQLite3: A lightweight database management system used for data storage.
- Bootstrap: A front-end framework used for responsive and attractive UI.
- Machine Learning (ML): A trained ML model is used to predict COVID-19 cases based on X-ray images. You can find dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tawsifurrahman/covid19-radiography-database).
